# HW 2
John Adams A16499049

I did not do any of the bonus points, but I did implement a lazy z-buffer occlusion (doesn't use the hierarchy, checks per-pixel) and a 2D-BoundingBox acceleration into 2.4 to speed up rendering. (It's about 106x faster than without those two accelerations)

## 2.5 Design a Scene

Honestly It took me like 2 hours to figure out how to map textures to vertex coordinates so I don't think I have the patience to set up a proper scene. So you get Luigi.

Credits to Nintendo (because he is ripped directly out of Super Mario Bros. Wonder) I did some surface subdivision on his eyes and hat to improve the texture rendering in those locations.

He has 26417 Vertices and I got it to render in only 0.175 seconds on an M1, so I think that's pretty optimized if I do say so myself.

## 2 Bonus (Accelerate with Bounding Boxes)
I did implement a bounding box rendering accelerator
(can be turned on by compiling with `boundingBox = 1`).

I did not see very large speedup, although I assume this has more to do with the very small number of objects that were drawn for each scene. These are the render time differences for each scene.

0: 0.0034 -> 0.0030

1: 0.0122 -> 0.0104

2: 0.0051 -> 0.0032

3: 0.0043 -> 0.0038

4: 0.0061 -> 0.0055

---

Side note: I also implemented the bounding box rendering for part 3 because I thought we were supposed to lol. I dropped it for 4+ because it took more code to implement.

## 4 Bonus (Animation)
I attempted this, but was unable to do it. For whatever reason (something to do with the Linker and CMake I think) I wasn't able to make a global variable to handle the animation progress (I was going to implement it within the transform parsing). I didn't want to rewrite all the function headers to implement some kind of progress variable so I gave up on that.


## 7 (Design a Scene)
I made a holiday phone background. It has a moon, some rolling hills, a pine tree and a present box under snowfall.

scene: `scenes/hw1/holiday.json`

image: `outputs/holiday.png`

I hope you like it :)


## 8 Bonus (Lines & Curves)
I did not do this bonus. Have a lot of work this weekend. If I finish early than I suppose I might resubmit.
